**NOTICE**: *This SDK is still very much work-in-progress. The interface is subject to rapid change.
If you would like a stable way to access all that Deepgram has to offer, please use the
[Deepgram API](https://developers.deepgram.com/api-reference/) directly until this SDK has been stabilized.*

Official Rust SDK for Deepgram's automated speech recognition APIs.

To access the API you will need a Deepgram account. Sign up for free at [console.deepgram.com](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?utm_medium=github&utm_source=DEVREL&utm_content=deepgram-rust-sdk).

You can learn more about the full Deepgram API at [developers.deepgram.com](https://developers.deepgram.com).
